This is the extremely compact command line interpreter for TOS, KAOS and MagiC.
By changing the first lines one can choose with variant to build.

The executable should be named as follows:

- MCMD for MagiC
- KCMD for KAOS
- CMD for TOS
- as accessory (.ACC)

The TOS version tries to avoid operating system bugs that do not exist without TOS.

This program seems to be not localised, i.e. is written for Germany.
